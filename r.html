<h2>A rudimentary Lisp interpreter and compiler, inspired by Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-35.html#%_thm_5.51">exercises 5.51 and 5.52</a></h2>

<h3>Exercise 5.51.</h3>

<p>"Develop a rudimentary implementation of Scheme in C (or some other
low-level language of your choice) by translating the explicit-control
evaluator of section 5.4 into C. In order to run this code you will
need to also provide appropriate storage-allocation routines and other
run-time support."</p>

<p>C is a bit higher-level than the register machine language that the
explicit control evaluator is written in, so I basically translated
the meta-circular evaluator to C instead.</p>

<h3>Exercise 5.52.</h3>

<p>"As a counterpoint to exercise 5.51, modify the compiler so that it
compiles Scheme procedures into sequences of C instructions. Compile
the metacircular evaluator of section 4.1 to produce a Scheme
interpreter written in C."</p>

<p>The compiler here is basically a translator which takes as input
register machine code and emits C.</p>

<h3>features/bugs:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The repl doesn't handle two s-expression on a one line, ignores the second one.</li>
<li>Primitives don't check for arity, so (quote foo bar) is just foo, and not an error.</li>
<li>No tail-call optimization</li>
<li>No garbage collection</li>
<li>No user-defined macros, altho a macro system is in place for "system" macros</li>
<li>Not much error checking
<ul>
<li>bombs on bad filenames to load</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
