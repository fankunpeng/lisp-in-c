A rudimentary Lisp written in C

Inspired by:
the last two exercises in SICP http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-35.html#%_thm_5.51

Bugs and issues -- set aside for now:

1. Doesn't handle two s-expression on a one line correctly
2. Primitive numeric procedures should calculate the number of digits in result
5. quoted shouldn't take more than one arg
