A rudimentary Lisp written in C as part of the last [two](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-35.html#%_thm_5.51) exercises of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Bugs and issues -- set aside for now:

1. Doesn't handle two s-expression on a one line correctly
2. Primitive numeric procedures should calculate the number of digits in result
4. no special handling of strings -- essentially treated as symbols
5. quoted shouldn't take more than one arg
6. definitions of the form (define (foo ...)) not handled
