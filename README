A rudimentary Lisp interpreter written in C

Bugs and issues -- set aside for now:

1. Doesn't handle two s-expression on a one line correctly
2. Primitive numeric procedures should calculate the number of digits in result
3. Something wrong with (quote (foo bar))
4. no special handling of strings -- essentially treated as symbols
5. quoted shouldn't take more than one arg
6. definitions of the form (define (foo ...)) not handled
